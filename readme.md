Custom Content Shortcode
============

This is version 1.3.0-beta, currently under development and testing. For production, please use the [stable release](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-shortcode/).

The **[loop]** and **[content]** have been rewritten for better code organization and optimizing for performance. All other modules are being updated also.

Here is a list of features still missing:

* [if first/last/empty]

* [if gallery] - if current post has images in the gallery field

* Exclude current post from [loop]

* [br], [p]

* [redirect] - make it possible to set URL as parameter or as content

* Documentation for [raw] and [cache]

* Test and improve shortcodes for ACF: Gallery, Repeater, Flexible Content, Relationship
