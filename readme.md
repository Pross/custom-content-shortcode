Custom Content Shortcode
============

For production, please use the [stable release](http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-content-shortcode/).

This is version 1.3.0-beta, currently under development and testing. I've rewritten the [loop] and [content] from the ground up, and improved other modules, for overall code organization and optimizing for performance.

Here is a list of features still missing:

* [if first/last/empty]
* [if gallery] - if current post has images in the gallery field
* [br], [p]
* Documentation for [raw] and [cache]

* ACF: Gallery, Repeater, Flexible Content, Relationship

* Exclude current post from [loop]
